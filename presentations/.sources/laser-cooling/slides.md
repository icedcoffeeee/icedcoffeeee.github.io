# What is Laser Cooling

- Laser cooling is a groundbreaking technique in atomic physics that
  involves using carefully tuned laser light to slow down and cool the
  motion of atoms.
- In many scientific experiments, achieving ultra-cold temperatures is
  essential for studying quantum phenomena and performing high-precision
  measurements.
- The development of laser cooling techniques began with the pioneering
  work of <span class="text-red-500">Steven Chu, Claude Cohen-Tannoudji, and William D.
  Phillips</span>, who were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1997 for
  their contributions to the field.

# Doppler Cooling

<div class="w-full pr-10">
By tuning lasers to a frequency slightly below an atomic transition, the
<Underline>Doppler effect</Underline> causes atoms moving toward the laser to
absorb photons, reducing their velocity.

# Radiation Pressure

<div>
Photons emitted in random directions as atoms spontaneously decay create a
<Underline>recoil force</Underline> that cools the atom.

# Laser Cooling in Practice

- <Underline>Continuous wave (CW)</Underline> lasers for steady cooling and
  pulsed lasers for specific applications.
- Techniques such as resolved <Underline>sideband cooling</Underline>, where
  the cooling laser is tuned to a specific vibrational frequency of the trapped
  atoms.
